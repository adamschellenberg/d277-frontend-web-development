            <p>Arizona is the 48th state (but #1 in humor, which we've scattered around this website), having gained statehood on February 14, 1912. We're the birthplace of popular bands such as 
                Jimmy Eat World, Meat Puppets, Scary Kids Scaring Kids, Alice Cooper (the band) and Blessthefall. But you knew that, right?
            </p>

            <p>Okay, look. We might not be as cool as Alaska, or as green as Tennessee, but trust me, we're worth a visit. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0" target="_blank" style="color: blue">Click here</a> to see all the cool stuff AZ has to offer!</p>
